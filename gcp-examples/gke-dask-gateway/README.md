# Google Cloud VM Example

Deploy a network and a GKE cluster on Google Cloud via
Terraform. This infrastructure will host a deployment of
[`dask-gateway`](https://gateway.dask.org/).

## Setup

Download / Configure the following

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- gcloud:
  - [Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
  - [Configure](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing)
  - Create and download a
  [service account key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys) 
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/)

If you want to run the example notebook to connect to the
gateway, you will also need:

- [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)

You will also need to add the `conda-forge` channel.

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

## Deployment

Input variables into `your-cluster.tfvars` if you want
options that differ from the defaults in `variables.tf`.
Using these variables will require adding the following flag
to all `terraform` commands: `--var-file=your-cluster.tfvars`.

In particular, you will need to supply the filepath of your
service account key to the `credential_file` input variable.

And yes, you need both the `google` and the `google-beta`
providers.

Once you are ready to deploy, you can look at the plan with:

```
terraform plan --var-file your-cluster.tfvars
```

Deploy the network and cluster with:

```
terraform apply --var-file your-cluster.tfvars
```

## Install `dask-gateway`

To install `dask-gateway` onto the cluster, there are a few
steps:
- Make sure Helm is installed (listed above)
- Update your `kubeconfig` file with:
```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <your-cluster-name> --region <your-region>
```
- Add your `gcloud` credentials to kubernetes as a secret.
This is the same key referenced above in "create and download
a service account key."
```
kubectl -n dask-gateway create secret generic dask-worker-sa-key --from-file <~/path/to/key/file.json>
```
- Install `dask-gateway`
```
kubectl create ns dask-gateway
helm repo add daskgateway https://dask.org/dask-gateway-helm-repo/
helm repo update
helm upgrade --install -n dask-gateway --version 0.8.0 --values dask-gateway-config.yaml dask-gateway daskgateway/dask-gateway
```

## Connecting to the Gateway

As an example to connect to and use the gateway, there is
a conda environment and a Jupyter notebook.

A conda environment file is provided:
`dask-gateway-test-env.yaml`. We use it to match the package
versions that will be present on the dask cluster. To
activate this environment, use

```
conda env create -f dask-gateway-test-env.yaml
conda activate dask-gateway-test-env
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
jupyter labextension install dask-labextension
jupyter serverextension enable dask_labextension
```

There is a Jupyter Notebook provided as an example of how
to connect to the gateway. Launch it with

```
jupyter lab
```

Once you are done with the notebook, you should run the
last cell that has

```
client.close()
cluster.close()
```

to shut down your `dask-gateway` cluster. Then shut down
the JupyterLab session at File > Shut Down.

To remove this environment, run

```
conda deactivate
conda remove --name dask-gateway-test-env --all
```

More general information on connecting to the gateway is in
the `dask` documentation:
https://gateway.dask.org/install-kube.html#connecting-to-the-gateway

Other information for using the gateway for computations
is in the `dask` documentation as well:
https://gateway.dask.org/usage.html

### Notes on this `dask-gateway` Deployment

This deployment is not secure. Anyone with the IP address
of the dask cluster can get into it and run computations.

## Tear Down `dask-gateway`

This must be performed before trying to tear down the
infrastructure, otherwise the `terraform destroy` command
will fail.

```
helm delete dask-gateway -n dask-gateway
```

It may take a few moments after the command returns for

```
kubectl get svc -n dask-gateway
```

to show that all the `LoadBalancer`s are cleaned up. Do not
move on until the above comand tells you

```
No resources found in dask-gateway namespace.
```

## Tear Down the Infrastructure

Remove the network and cluster with:

```
terraform destroy --var-file your-cluster.tfvars
```

Your `kubeconfig` file will still have the information for the
cluster until you manually delete it. You can remove it as
follows:

```
kubectl config delete-cluster <your-cluster-arn>
kubectl config delete-context <your-cluster-context>
kubectl config unset users.<user-name>
```

You can get those variables with the corresponding commands:

- `your-cluster-arn`: `kubectl config get-clusters`
- `your-cluster-context`: `kubectl config get-contexts`
- `user-name`: `kubectl config view`, the name you want will
look something like
`arn:aws:eks:us-west-2:############:cluster/<your-cluster>`.

If you had a previous kubectl context set, you may also want
to set it to be something else with

```
kubectl config use-context <different context>
```
